    <h1 className={styles.heading}>FAQS</h1>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>WHERE ARE YOU BASED?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Velour Garments was born and still remains in Barcelona, Spain, where
  through a network of small family business and textile artisans we stand
  for local craftsmanship.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>WHAT MATERIALS DO YOU USE?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Most of our products are made out of 100% organic cotton, which is
  developed and milled locally by ourselves ensuring that it meets all
  quality and sustainability standards in accordance with current European
  regulations.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>HOW SHOULD I WASH YOUR PRODUCTS?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Being 100% organic cotton, we always recommend to wash every single
  garment at cold temperatures (anywhere between 20ºC and 30ºC) selecting
  a gentle cycle on your washing machine and using softener soap in order
  to maintain the fabric's properties. Once washed, please avoid machine /
  tumble drying and let your garments line-dry naturally.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>WHAT IS THE PROCESS BEHIND EACH PRODUCT?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  After weaving and knitting the raw cotton threads and turning them into
  fabric rolls, they are checked one by one and then sent to the workshop
  where we hand-cut each and every one of the pieces that make up the
  pattern of the garment.
</p>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Once cut, all the pieces are individually put together in the sewing
  atelier by experienced seamstresses, in order to be later taken to the
  dyeing laboratory, where through a natural dyeing process we achieve the
  final color result and get rid of all possible imperfections.
</p>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  The final steps are the quality check, where we inspect every garment,
  followed by the ironing and packaging processes prior to its shipping to
  you.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>WHERE DO YOU PRODUCE YOUR GARMENTS?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Our whole production is local, being fully manufactured between Barcelona
  and surrounding towns. This allows us to directly control each and every
  part of the production process and guarantee the highest quality for each
  garment.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>DO YOU SHIP WORLDWIDE?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Yes, we ship internationally to most countries worldwide. Shipping costs
  and times will be calculated at checkout depending on your location.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>HOW LONG DOES SHIPPING TAKE?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Orders within Spain usually take 2–4 business days, while international
  orders may take anywhere from 5–15 business days depending on the
  destination and local customs processing.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>CAN I RETURN OR EXCHANGE AN ITEM?</h2>
<p className={styles.paragraph}>
  Yes, you may return or exchange your item within 14 days of receiving it,
  provided it is in its original condition and packaging. Please see our
  Returns & Exchanges policy for more details.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.heading}>HOW CAN I CONTACT YOU?</h2>
